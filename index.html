          <p>
            The Egyptian Lighthouse in the Venetian port of Chania constitutes an absolute jewel of the city
            and its most photographed monument. Despite the adjective “Egyptian” that is attributed to the Lighthouse,
            it was built by the Venetians in the late 16th century and is one of the oldest in the world,fact that makes it so special.

        <h4>Famous Cretans' Quotes</h4>
        <p>
          <span class="quotes">“</span> I knew that no matter what door you knock on in a Cretan village, it will be opened for you. A meal will be served in your honor,
          and you will sleep between the best sheets in the house. In Crete, the stranger is still the unknown god. Before him, all doors
          and all hearts are opened.<span class="quotes">”</span>
